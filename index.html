    <h1>Howard Walter Florey, Baron Florey</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">OM FRS FRCP (24 September 1898 â€“ 21 February 1968),
        was an Australian pharmacologist and pathologist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945
        with Ernst Chain and Sir Alexander Fleming for his role in the development of penicillin. </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin, it was Florey
        and his team at the University of Oxford who made it into a useful and effective drug, ten years after Fleming
        had abandoned its development. </p>
    <p class="paragraph3">They developed techniques for growing, purifying and manufacturing the drug, tested it for
        toxicity and efficacy on animals, and carried out the first clinical trials. In 1941, they used it to treat a
        police constable from Oxford. He started to recover, but subsequently died because Florey was unable, at that
        time, to make enough penicillin.
    </p>
    <div class="paragraph4">Later trials in Britain,the United States and North Africa were highly successful. A
        graduate of the University of Adelaide,Florey studied at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and in
        the United States on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation.</div>
